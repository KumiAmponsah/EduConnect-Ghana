Create a new reactjs page called Forumn.
Create a very nice an beautiful navigation bar consiting of the links - Discussion  Resources Updates   a round profile container for profile pricyute, log out links
Let the navigation bar have it's own file. Navigation.js and Navigation.css
Let it look really pretty and beautiful. Let the navigation bar be seen in the Forumn page, but let navigation bar have it's own files


width of the navigation should extend to the end but there should be a small margin on right and left sides
It should be responsive on any screen, use a gradient of blue and white for the background colour of the navigation bar. Give me full updated codes




Now, style and edit the codes so that the formn page will look like real beuatiful discussion forumn.Do thorough editing, let the page be responsive. Give me full updated codes.
Let the inputs spread out, they seem in the middle, let the user's input appear om the left side of the screen, not middle. When the like emoji is tapped, let the number of likes increase.. Lt the count start from zero. When reply link is tapped, let there be a openeing of a new beautiful styled nput where user can type, then sumbit onto the screen.




shift the messages to the left of the screen, they shouldn't be in th midlle like the heading. Also change the input to just the shape with message, because that is just displaying the message the user typed. Anytime a user types a message, it goes onto the screen, following the order like real chatting apps. Make the necessary chamges:




When a user types a message, let the message go to the far left end of thescreen. here the messages are under the influenc of content and forumn-page. let the centeredness of the other contents of the page not affect the messages. Let the messages be outsdie the computer sciencestyling, such that the messages will be aligned on the left of the screen, not on the eft of teh red background content



move the computer sciencetest to the top center
display messages under the computer on the left like real chatting apps.
Let the chats benath the compuetr scirnce be scrollable, but the input and the computer science is not scrollable.
